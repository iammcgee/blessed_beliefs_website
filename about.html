    <h2>About This Site</h2>
    <p>This site was created for people who come from broken homes, confusing upbringings, or generational cycles they can't explain but deeply feel. If that’s you — you’re not alone. You’ve probably carried pain for years without knowing where to put it. This place is where you start to let it go.</p>

    <p>Everything here — from the books to the prayers to the future courses — is designed to help you understand your story, confront what broke you, and invite Jesus Christ into the process of healing and rebuilding. This isn’t a perfect ministry. It’s not a business trying to sell healing. It’s a real work born out of real pain, created to help people walk out of spiritual and emotional captivity with clarity, power, and peace.</p>

    <p>If you’ve been trying to survive without answers, numb out without healing, or break cycles without God — this site was made for you. It’s time to get free. It’s time to get whole. One step at a time, one truth at a time — we walk forward together, with Christ leading the way.</p>
