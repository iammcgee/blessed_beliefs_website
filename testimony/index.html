      <h2>Jesus Saved Me from a Curse I Couldn't Break</h2>

      <p>I was born the first of eight kids in a chaotic, broken family. My mom and dad had me and my brother together, but after that, everything shattered. My sister Helena was born from my mom’s affair with a married man. Then my dad left to be with another woman who already had a kid, and eventually he left her too, for a woman with three kids from another man. That’s how I got my brother Ryan—same dad, different mom.</p>

      <p>Meanwhile, my mom dated a string of men. Some she almost married. Eventually, she married my stepdad and had another daughter—Trinity. So I grew up in a swirling mess of half-siblings, step-parents, and emotional wreckage.</p>

      <p>The worst part? Both my parents and step-parents claimed to be Christians. So I figured Jesus was just a front—some character they used to justify hurting people. I had no reason to trust Him.</p>

      <p>Anyways, my mom had custody, and I deeply resented her. She treated me like a stand-in husband, a counselor, and a caretaker for all the younger kids. I longed to be with my dad, but he had violent outbursts and couldn’t hold peace either. Worse, my mom weaponized him—using the threat of him to control us.</p>

      <p>I rebelled early. Got kicked out of daycare and public school for refusing to obey. My mom moved us farther away, making visits with my dad harder. I hated it. Hated growing up without him. I even tried to end my life in high school with a bunch of pills.</p>

      <p>I had terrifying night terrors and sleep paralysis. One dream stuck with me: I floated, paralyzed, while watery, human-shaped creatures marched toward me. Just as they reached out to grab me, they collapsed into puddles. I ran downstairs in the dream—and found my mom, stepdad, and baby sister wearing these horrifying Renaissance-pig hybrid masks. It looked like they were performing some ritual and were looking to me to join them. I lost all trust after that.</p>

      <p>I tried to escape into football. Into grades. Into girls. Nothing worked.</p>

      <p>Inside the house? Chaos. Cursing. Physical fights. My brother once held a big kitchen knife to my stepdad's throat. My mom screaming. Me trying to keep peace and protect my siblings while everything around me was on fire.</p>

      <p>When I finally moved in with my dad, I thought it’d be better. But that house had its own curse. Rage, tension, confusion. You never knew what would set things off.</p>

      <p>I ran to sex. Porn. Anything to numb the pain. But it only made things worse.</p>

      <p>I was tormented with violence and lust. It wasn’t some ordinary craving. It felt like there was something crawling beneath my skin—something ancient—that demanded I release my seed like it was farming me.</p>

      <p>I had dreams that weren’t like dreams. They were realer than real, and I knew deep down they were spiritual.</p>

      <p>One night, in a dream, I saw a cat spirit. It didn’t speak. It didn’t move much. It just flew through the sky, and gave me this look… and I released my seed. Just from its gaze.</p>

      <p>It was like demonstrating its dominion over me. I woke up stunned and ashamed, thinking, “How in the world did this thing have that kind of power over me?”</p>

      <p>Another time later, I had a lucid dream where I saw a being—something seductive, feminine, but not alive. It was like a spiritual bot, crafted to look like a temptress, but you could tell there was no soul. No life. Just code. Just design.</p>

      <p>It would come in the night to collect my seed, like I was a product, like I was being harvested.</p>

      <p>I’d wake up feeling violated and confused. And worse—powerless.</p>

      <p>I couldn’t go a single day without feeling that burning compulsion. If I didn’t release, it was like barbed wire under my skin. I didn’t want to live like this. It wasn’t pleasure anymore. It was slavery.</p>

      <p>I started learning about forgiveness and knew I had to forgive my parents. I did. I told them face to face. But when I started speaking out about the family dysfunction, I was scapegoated. Outcasted. Still, I moved forward.</p>

      <p>Met my wife. She saw she had to forgive her parents too. So she did, and we got married. Started our own family.</p>

      <p>But that curse was still in me. I had an endless hunger for sex. I even told my wife I felt like I needed a mistress or concubine just to survive. I was feeling guilty for the sheer amount of sex I felt I was requiring. The lust wasn’t even pleasurable anymore—it was torment. It was slavery.</p>

      <p>One night, I had a lucid vision where I saw a Roman man raping and killing a wicked woman—both full of hatred. God was showing me the spirit that had a grip on me went back thousands of years. I didn’t know what to do with it. But I couldn’t deny that something ancient, violent, and sexual was embedded in me.</p>

      <p>I tried everything. Reading. Working. Journaling. Eating right. Exercising. Nothing fixed the curse.</p>

      <p>Then one night—I was laying in bed, seized up like a mummy. That cursed feeling was calling me again, trying to summon me into violent sex. I was exhausted. Empty. Nothing had worked.</p>

      <p>And in that desperation, I whispered in my heart: “Jesus?”</p>

      <p>Not a prayer. Not a sermon. Just a call. Like a final SOS to see what would happen.</p>

      <p>And instantly—instantly—that cursed feeling left me. No thunder. No tears. Just like turning on the light in a dark room. Gone.</p>

      <p>I sat up like, “Wait… what?”</p>

      <p>For almost two decades, I had lived with this wicked pressure in my body. And now, it was just… gone?</p>

      <p>I told my wife. I laughed. I danced. I had never felt so clean. So free. So alive.</p>

      <p>For the first time in my life, I knew Jesus wasn’t just some religious figure. He was real. He was kind. He was strong. And He helped me, personally—no pastor, no parent, just Him.</p>

      <p>The lust didn’t come back. The torment stopped. I could walk past women dressed in all kinds of ways, and nothing burned in me anymore. It wasn’t discipline—it was deliverance.</p>

      <p>Now, every morning, I spend time with Jesus. Sometimes we don’t even talk. We just rest in the moment, like best friends lying in the grass, holding hands in the sun.</p>

      <p>He started showing me things—who I really am, what authority I carry, how I’m not a victim. I asked Him what He wanted to do one day when I ran out of things to ask and do, and He showed me Leviathan—this giant dinosaur-looking snake. But I wasn’t scared. His presence didn't allow worry. He let me just experience it like a kid in front of a huge skyscraper, like “Wooaahh look at how big it is!!” And in an instant He turned this huge snake into a little baby creature. He held it in an orb in His palm, smiling. He showed me that nothing is greater than Him.</p>

      <p>The first time after being delivered I set time out to intentionally speak with Jesus. I was so nervous and didn't really know what to say. I awkwardly asked Jesus, “So, what are you doing today?”</p>

      <p>And He said, “Saving the world.”</p>

      <p>I looked down and laughed so hard, man. Jesus is literally the greatest superhero of all time.</p>

      <p>I used to think He was fake—just a cover-up for abuse and religion. But Jesus didn’t hold any of that against me. He just showed up. He just helped. And He never left.</p>

      <p>I was thinking that I was supposed to save myself, but He rescued me from a curse I couldn’t name, explain, or escape.</p>

      <p>It’s so much better being saved than running around trying to be the superhero that Jesus is.</p>

      <p>And now? I’m finally free. I thought I was just going to have to get used to living with that curse, but now my life has never been better. My relationship with God is thriving, my relationship with my wife and children and everyone I meet is thriving, my business is thriving, I'm meeting amazing people like you in this group, my mind is free from fog, I can think straight now that I don't have that curse burning in me.</p>

      <p><strong>Jesus is Lord! Amen.</strong></p>

      <hr>
      <p>I’m not sharing this for attention. I’m sharing this because I know someone out there has lived a story that feels just as broken, just as haunted, just as heavy.</p>
      <p>And if that’s you—if you’ve been walking through life carrying something you can’t name, explain, or shake—I want you to know there is real hope. Real freedom. And His name is Jesus.</p>
      <p>I’ll be a willing vessel until the day I die if it helps even one person find the same freedom I found. If anything in this spoke to you, know this:</p>
      <p><strong>You’re not alone. And your story’s not over.</strong></p>
      <p>Jesus is the one who rescued me—and He can rescue you too.</p>
